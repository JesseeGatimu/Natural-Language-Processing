Living in groups called pods, dolphins work together to hunt, play, and protect each other from predators. They use a range of sounds, including clicks and whistles, as well as body language, to communicate within their pods. Dolphins are also known for their remarkable ability to use echolocation, which helps them navigate and find food in the vast ocean. Their friendly and curious behavior has made them favorites among marine biologists and ocean enthusiasts, as well as symbols of harmony between humans and marine life.")
